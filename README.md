Description:
our metric is the best neighborhood to survive a purge in. We measured crime rates, number of grocery stores, and . In comparing these metrics we found that Squirrel hill south was the best neighborhood. this neighborhood was close enough to the strip district which has a large number of grocery stores and not many people. The strip district also ranks 5th in the city facilities category. meaning it has a lot of supporting infastructure like electricity and running water. Squirrel hill south also has the second lowest crime rate. so as anarchy ensues you willl be safe and once the dust settles youll have a short stroll to the nearest supply rich neighborhoood.
